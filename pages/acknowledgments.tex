First, I want to thank my external supervisor Dr. Carsten Marr, at Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Center, Munich. I am thankful to him for creating a productive working environment and for providing his valuable feedback throughout the course of my thesis. I also want to thank my advisors Ali Boushehri and Dominik Waibel. They supported me greatly by providing guidance during our weekly meetings and discussions. They also took the lead with writing a research paper based on the findings of the thesis. We submitted the research paper to Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2021. I also want to thank my supervisor Prof. Dr. Bjoern Menze from the TUM for supervising my master thesis. \\
I want to thank my friends and family, who rendered their full support during the course of the thesis.
