First of all I want to thank my external supervisor Dr. Carsten Marr for giving me the opportunity to work on this project and creating a productive working environment within his research group at the Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Center Munich. I also want to thank my direct supervisors Ali Boushehri and Dominik Waibel for great support throughout the whole project and appreciate all the time they invested in insightful meetings and discussions. I also want to thank my internal supervisor Prof. Dr. Bjoern Menze from the TUM for supervising my external master thesis.
