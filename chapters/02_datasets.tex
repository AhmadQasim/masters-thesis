\chapter{Datasets}\label{chapter:datasets}
This thesis compares the performance of different active learning algorithms, pre-training methods and training strategies on three biomedical image datasets, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:datasets_composition}. We chose these datasets as representatives of biomedical imaging classification tasks, considering their imbalanced nature as well as similarity among classes. In the following, we introduce each dataset.

They are taken from peripheral blood smears of 100 patients diagnosed with AML, as well as 100 patients without any symptoms of the disease \cite{matek2019, clark2013}.

\section{White Blood Cell Dataset}

The white blood cell dataset contains 18357 single-cell images labeled by experts taken from peripheral blood smears of 100 patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as 100 patients without any symptoms of the disease. 

White blood cells, also known as leukocytes, are the cells which protect the body from foreign objects and infections. White blood cells are found throughout the body including the blood.

AML is a cancer occurring in the myeloid line of blood cells. Its symptoms include the rapid growth of abnormal cells which interfere with normal blood cells production due to a build-up in the bone marrow and the blood. Symptoms can include continuous feeling of tiredness, being out of breath frequently, and high risk of infection. At certain occasions, the cancer can metastasize and spread to other organs of the body. AML progresses quickly and can prove to be fatal in a matter of months. AML is initially treated using chemotherapy. The goal of chemotherapy is to set a remission in motion. Other treatments include radiation therapy or a stem cell transplant. The treatment is guided by the type of mutation present within the body. This also dictates, how long a person is likely to live.

During the formulation of the dataset, the malignant and non-malignant white blood cells were classified into a standard morphological classification scheme. To quantify account of uncertainties between the expert labeling, a subset of images was re-labeled up to two times.

The dataset has been used as the primary dataset for testing different active learning algorithms, training strategies and pre-training methods.

\section{Skin Lesion Dataset}

The skin lesion dataset is developed by The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) also known as the Melanoma Project. The goal of this project is the application of medical imaging using computational technologies for detection of melanoma and eventually the reduction of melanoma mortality.

Melanoma, also called malignant melanoma, is a type of skin cancer. It is developed within the melanocyte cells. Melanocytes are responsible for producing pigments in the skin. Melanomas can also occur in other organs such as the mouth, intestines, and the eye. About 25\% of melanomas develop from moles. Symptoms such as increase in the size of a mole, irregular edges, color changes, itchiness or skin breakdown can indicate melanoma.

Melanoma treatment heavily depends on early detection. If detected in its early stages, Melanoma is readily curable. Skin lesion imaging can not only help with the education of experts and the public, but it can also be used for automated diagnosis, decision support in clinics and teledermatology. The quality of skin lesion imaging is hampered by a lack of dermatological standards. ISIC is working towards addressing the technologies, techniques and terminology used in skin imaging while focusing on the issues of privacy.

ISIC has developed and is expanding an open-source public access archive of skin images to test and validate the proposed standards. This archive consists of 25339 images for the development and testing of automated diagnostic systems.

Skin lesion dataset is used in this thesis to test the best performing combinations of active learning algorithms, training strategies and pre-training methods for White blood cell dataset.

\section{Cell Cycle Dataset}

The cell cycle dataset consists of 32272 images of jurkat cells which are growing in an asynchronous manner. The cells are captured with the ImageStream platform. The cells were fixed and then stained with propidium iodide to determine the DNA content of the cells. Mitotic protein monoclonal antibody were used to identify mitotic cells.

Jurkat cells are an immortalized line of human T lymphocyte cells. They are used to study various biological process related to T lymphocyte cells. In particular, jurkat cells can generate interleukin 2, and hence can be used for studying the vulnerability of cancer to various drugs and treatment options.

The images of the Jurkat cells in the Cell cycle dataset are labeled into the seven different phases which occur within a cell cycle.

The cell cycle consists of four distinct phases: G1 phase, S phase (synthesis), G2 phase (collectively known as interphase) and M phase (mitosis and cytokinesis). The M phase is further composed of four stages i.e., prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.

Differences in the rates of cellular division and differences in the amount of time spent in each stage of cellular division are important biomarkers for distinguishing between healthy and cancerous cells. Likewise, cancer cells can form malignant mitotic structures which can result in progression of the disease.
